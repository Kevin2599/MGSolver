# Multigrid OOP Solver
1D/2D/3D finite difference multigrid solver on regular grid. The skeleton of the code is the same as the perfect 2D multigrid solver provided by Achi Brandt. Everyone who is new to this should learn how masters do their work. I personally definitely want to meet the author and learn from him.

This code also serves as an example of how one can simply/generalize an existing code.

## Getting Started

This code is completely in OOP. For the 1D case, start from:
'''
TestCycle.run; % execute
TestCycle.plot(ans) % visualize
'''

### Prerequisites

MATLAB
